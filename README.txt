COMMENTS

Reed: 
I realized too late that we should have inherited faculty and student objects from a person class, as a few methods were duplicated for serialization were duplicated in the classes. This is the type of this we could have figured out ahead of time with more thorough planning.

Our readme is soooooo cute.
