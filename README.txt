COMMENTS

Reed: 
I realized too late that we should have inherited faculty and student objects from a person class, as a few methods were duplicated for serialization were duplicated in the classes. This is the type of this we could have figured out ahead of time with more thorough planning.

Our readme is soooooo cute.

James:
There are a few things that I would do differently when collaborating with people in the future.

Establish naming convensions for functions (Example: we always use the word "insert" instead of "add", or "remove" instead of "delete")

Establish file naming convensions, class naming convensions, function and variable naming convensions (Use whole words)

Establish style convensions (Example: camelCase functions but underscored_variables)

Establish a timeline of dependencies to determine what needs to be coded first

Thoroughly map out the architecture of the program before any coding (including the functions each class needs)

ALWAYS code the following in every class: Copy constructor, = operator, << operator and more if they make sense
 
Otherwise this was a very successful collaboration.  Github rocks.
